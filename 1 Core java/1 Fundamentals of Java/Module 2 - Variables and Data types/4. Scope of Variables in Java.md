# **Scope of Variables in Java**

The variable scope is the part of the program where the variable is accessible. The scope of the variable can be determined at compile time. There are mainly two types of variable scope.

<strong>1) Local Variables Scope: </strong>A variable that is defined inside a block, method body, or constructor is called a local variable. These variables canâ€™t be accessed outside the method.&nbsp;

**Example:**

    public class VariableScope{
        void method(){
            // local variable (method level scope)
            int x = 10;
        }
    }

<strong>2) Member/Class Level Variable Scope: </strong>A variable that is declared inside the class but outside the method body, block, or constructor is known as member/class level variable. These variables can be directly accessed anywhere in the class.

**Example:**

    public class VariableScope{
        
        // variable defined inside the class
        int x;
    }

    public class VariableScopeDemo{
        public static void main(String[] args){

            // creating VariableScope class object
            VariableScope obj = new VariableScope();

            // Assigning values in the variable
            obj.x = 10;

            // printing the value
            System.out.println(obj.x);
        }
    }
