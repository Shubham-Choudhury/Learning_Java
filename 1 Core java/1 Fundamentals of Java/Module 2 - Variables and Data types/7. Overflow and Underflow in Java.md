# **Overflow and Underflow in Java**

Overflow in java happens when we assign a value to a variable that is more than its range and Underflow is opposite to overflow. In case of overflow and underflow, the Java compiler doesn’t throw any error. It simply changes the value.&nbsp;

For example, in the case of an int variable, its size is 4 bytes or 32 bits. The maximum value of int data type is 2,147,483,647  (Integer.MAX_VALUE) and after incrementing 1 on this value, it will return -2,147,483,648 (Integer.MIN_VALUE). This is known as overflow. The minimum value of int data type is -2,147,483,648  (Integer.MIN_VALUE) and after decrementing 1 on this value, it will return 2,147,483,647 (Integer.MAX_VALUE). This is known as underflow in Java.

**Example:**

    public class OverflowUnderflow {
        public static void main(String args[]) {
    
            // Overflow
            int overFlow = 2147483647;
            System.out.println("Overflow : " + (overFlow + 1));
    
            // Underflow
            int underFlow = -2147483648;
            System.out.println("Underflow : " + (underFlow - 1));
        }
    }

**Output:**
    
        Overflow : -2147483648
        Underflow : 2147483647
