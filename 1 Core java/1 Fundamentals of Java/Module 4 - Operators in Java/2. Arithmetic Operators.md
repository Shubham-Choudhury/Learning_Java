# **Arithmetic Operators**

Arithmetic Operators in Java are used to perform mathematical operations, i.e. Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division etc. The basic arithmetic operators in Java are given below:

<ul>
    <li><strong>Addition Operator (+) : </strong>It is used to add two numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Subtraction Operator (-) :</strong> It is used to subtract two numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Multiplication Operator (*) :</strong> It is used to multiply two numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Division Operator (/) :</strong> It is used to divide two numbers.</li>
    <li><strong>Modulus Operator (%) :</strong> It is used to return the remainder of the division operation.</li>
</ul>

**Example:**

In this example, we are going to perform basic mathematical operations on two numbers. Letâ€™s see the example:

    public class ArithmeticOperators {
        public static void main(String[] args) {


            // Taking two numbers
            int a = 50;
            int b = 20;

            // performing addition operation
            System.out.println("Addition of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + (a + b));

            // performing subtraction operation
            System.out.println("Subtraction of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + (a - b));

            // performing multiplication operation
            System.out.println("Multiplication of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + (a * b));

            // performing division operation
            System.out.println("Division of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + (a / b));

            // performing modulus operation
            System.out.println("Modulus of " + a + " and " + b + " is : " + (a % b));

        }
    }

**Output:**
    
        Addition of 50 and 20 is : 70
        Subtraction of 50 and 20 is : 30
        Multiplication of 50 and 20 is : 1000
        Division of 50 and 20 is : 2
        Modulus of 50 and 20 is : 10
