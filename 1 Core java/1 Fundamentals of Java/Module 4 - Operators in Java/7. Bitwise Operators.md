# **Bitwise Operators**

The Bitwise operators are used to perform bit manipulation on numbers. There are various types of Bit operators that are used in Java.

<strong>i) Bitwise AND operator (&amp;):</strong>&nbsp; It takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1. Mind that the commutative property holds true here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,

    1 & 1 = 1
    1 & 0 = 0

**Example:**

    public class BitwiseAndOperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 6;
            int b = 7;

            // Binary representation of 6 is 0110
            // Binary representation of 7 is 0111
            // Result is                     0110 = 6
            System.out.println("a & b = " + (a & b));
        }
    }

**Output:**

    a & b = 6

<strong>ii) Bitwise OR operator (|):&nbsp;</strong> It takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. Mind that the commutative property holds true here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,

    1 | 1 = 1
    1 | 0 = 1
    0 | 0 = 0

**Example:**

    public class BitwiseOrOperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 6;
            int b = 7;

            // Binary representation of 6 is 0110
            // Binary representation of 7 is 0111
            // Result is                     0111 = 7
            System.out.println("a | b = " + (a | b));
        }
    }

**Output:**

    a | b = 7

<strong>iii) Bitwise NOT operator (~):</strong> It takes one number and inverts all bits of it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,

    ~1 = 0
    ~0 = 1

**Example:**

    public class BitwiseOrOperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 6;

            // Binary representation of 6 is 000000000000000000000000000000110       // 32 bit representation
            // complement is invert the bits 111111111111111111111111111111001, which is binary representation of -7      
            // Result is -7
            System.out.println("~a = " + ~a);
        }
    }

**Output:**

    ~a = -7

<strong>iv) Bitwise XOR&nbsp; operator (^):&nbsp; </strong>It takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. Mind that the commutative property holds true here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;That is,

    1 ^ 1 = 0
    1 ^ 0 = 1
    0 ^ 0 = 0

**Example:**

    public class BitwiseXOROperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 6;
            int b = 7;

            // Binary representation of 6 is 0110
            // Binary representation of 7 is 0111
            // Result is                     0001 = 1
            System.out.println("a ^ b = " + (a ^ b));
        }
    }

**Output:**

    a ^ b = 1

<strong>v) Left shift operator (&lt;&lt;): </strong>It takes two numbers, the left shift operator shifts the bits of the first operand, the second operand decides the number of places to shift.

**Example:**

    public class LeftShiftOperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 8;

            // Binary representation of 8 is 1000
            // Left shift means append numbr of
            // 0's to the right. 100000 = 32
            System.out.println("a << 2 = " + (a << 2));
        }
    }

**Output:**

    a << 2 = 32
