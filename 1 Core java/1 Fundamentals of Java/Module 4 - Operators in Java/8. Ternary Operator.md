# **Ternary Operator**

Java Ternary operator is also known as the conditional operator: This operator is the only conditional operator in java that takes three operands. We can use ternary operator in place of if-else statement or even switch statement. The syntax of the ternary operator is shown below:

    variable = expression1 ? expression2 : expression3

Here, if expression1 is true then expression2 is evaluated, else expression3 is evaluated.

**Example:**

    public class TernaryOperator {
        public static void main(String args[]){
            int a = 50;
            int b = 100;
            int minimum;

            // Printing the value of a and b
            System.out.println("First Number = " + a);
            System.out.println("Second Number = " + b);

            // Find the minimum number
            minimum = (a < b) ? a : b;

            // Printing the minimum number
            System.out.println("Minimum Number = " + minimum);
        }
    }

**Output:**

    First Number = 50
    Second Number = 100
    Minimum Number = 50
