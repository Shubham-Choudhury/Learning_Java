# **Iteration Statements**

Java iteration statements are used to repeat the set of statements until the condition of the
termination is true. There are three types of iteration statements in java.

**i) while loop:** Java while loop is used to repeat a statement or block of the statement until a
condition is true. We can use a while loop if the number of iterations is not fixed. The
condition of a while loop is any boolean expression. The loop will run till the condition is true,
if the condition becomes false the control goes to the next statement immediately following
the loop.

**Syntax:**

    initialization;
    while (condition) {
        // statements
        update_expression;
    }

**Example:**

    public class JavaWhileLoop {
        public static void main(String arg[]) {

            // Initialization
            int i = 1;

            // While loop run till the
            // condition is true
            while(i < = 10) {
                System.out.print(i + “ “);

                // Increment the value by 1.
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

**Output:**

    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

**ii) do-while loop:** Java do-while loop is also used to repeat a statement until a condition is
true. Sometimes in our program we want to execute the body of the loop at least once, even
if the conditional expression is false, in other words, there are times when you would like to
test the conditional expression at the end of the loop rather than the beginning. Then we
should go for a do-while loop in java. It executes the body loop at least once because the
conditional expression is checking at the end. Let’s look at the example to understand this.

**Syntax:**

    initialization;
    do {
        // statements
        update_expression;
    } while (condition);

**Example:**

    public class JavaDoWhileLoop {
        public static void main(String arg[]) {

            // Initialization
            int i = 1;
            do {
                System.out.print(i + “ “);
                i++;

            }

            // Checking condition at the end
            while(i <= 10);
        }
    }

**Output:**
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

**iii) for loop:** The for loop in java is used to iterate a part of the program several times. It
consumes the initialization, condition checking, and increment/decrement a value in one line.
If the number of iterations is fixed then it is recommended you use Java for loop.

**Syntax:**

    for (initialization; condition; update_expression) {
        // statements
    }

**Example:**
    
        public class JavaForLoop {
            public static void main(String arg[]) {
    
                // Initialization
                int i = 1;
    
                // For loop run till the
                // condition is true
                for(i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
                    System.out.print(i + “ “);
                }
            }
        }

**Output:**
    
    1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10

**Java Enhanced for loop:** Java Enhanced for loop provides a simpler way to iterate through
the elements of a collection or array. It is used when we need to sequentially iterate through
elements without knowing the index of the currently processing element

**Syntax:**

    for (type variableName : arrayName) {
        // statements
    }

**Example:**
    
        public class JavaEnhancedForLoop {
            public static void main(String arg[]) {
        
                // Initialization
                int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        
                // For loop run till the
                // condition is true
                for(int i : numbers) {
                    System.out.print(i + “ “);
                }
            }
        }

**Output:**
        
    1 2 3 4 5
