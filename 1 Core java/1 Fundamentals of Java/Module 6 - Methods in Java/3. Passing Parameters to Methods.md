# **Passing Parameters to Methods**

**Pass by value in java:**

The formal parameters are allocated to a new memory when the parameters are passed to a function using the pass-by-value method. The value of these parameters is the same as the value of the actual parameters. Changes in formal parameters would not represent changes in individual parameters because they are assigned to the new memory.

**Example:**

    public class PassByValue {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            int a = 10;
            int b = 20;
            System.out.println("Before swapping, a = " + a + " and b = " + b);
            swapFunction(a, b);
            System.out.println("\n**Now, Before and After swapping values will be same here**:");
            System.out.println("After swapping, a = " + a + " and b is " + b);
        }

        public static void swapFunction(int a, int b) {
            System.out.println("Before swapping(Inside), a = " + a + " b = " + b);
            // Swap n1 with n2
            int c = a;
            a = b;
            b = c;
            System.out.println("After swapping(Inside), a = " + a + " b = " + b);
        }
    }

**Output:**
    
        Before swapping, a = 10 and b = 20
        Before swapping(Inside), a = 10 b = 20
        After swapping(Inside), a = 20 b = 10
    
        **Now, Before and After swapping values will be same here**:
        After swapping, a = 10 and b is 20
