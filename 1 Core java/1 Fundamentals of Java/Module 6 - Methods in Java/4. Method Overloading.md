# **Method Overloading**

Method overloading in Java is when a class has multiple methods of the same name but different parameters. The main advantage of the method overloading is to increase the readability of the program. Method overloading is related to compile-time polymorphism. You will learn more about this in OOPs as well.

<br><strong>Ways to overload a method: </strong>There are two ways to overload a method in java

<ul>
    <li>By changing the number of arguments.</li>
    <li>By changing the data type.</li>
</ul>

**Method overloading with changing the number of arguments.**

In this example, we have created two methods, the first add() method performs the addition of the two numbers, and the second add() method performs the addition of the three numbers. Letâ€™s look at the example

    public class Adder {
        // Method to add two numbers
        static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        // Method to add three numbers
        static int add(int a, int b, int c) {
            return a + b + c;
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(add(10, 20));
            System.out.println(add(10, 20, 30));
        }
    }

**Output:**
    
    30
    60

**Method overloading with changing the data type of arguments.**
In this example, we have created two add() methods with different data types. The first add() method takes two integer arguments and the second add() takes two double arguments.&nbsp;

    public class Adder {
        // Method to add two integers
        static int add(int a, int b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        // Method to add two double
        static double add(double a, double b) {
            return a + b;
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            System.out.println(add(10, 20));
            System.out.println(add(10.5, 20.5));
        }
    }

**Output:**
        
    30
    31.0
