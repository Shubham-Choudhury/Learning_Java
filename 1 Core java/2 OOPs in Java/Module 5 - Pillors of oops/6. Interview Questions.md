# **Interview Questions**

## **Q1.What is the difference between compile-time polymorphism and runtime polymorphism?**

| Compile Time Polymorphism | Run time Polymorphism |
| --- | --- |
| Compile time polymorphism is also known as static polymorphism. | Run time polymorphism is also known as dynamic polymorphism. |
| In this, method overloading is used to achieve polymorphism. | In this, method overriding is used to achieve polymorphism. |
| In this, binding is done at compile time. | In this, binding is done at run time. |
| It provides fast execution because the method that needs to be executed is known early at the compile time. | It provides slow execution as compare to early binding because the method that needs to be executed is known at the runtime. |
| Compile time polymorphism is less flexible as all things execute at compile time. | Run time polymorphism is more flexible as all things execute at run time.|
| Inheritance is not involved. | Inheritance is involved.|


## **Q2.What is the Java instanceOf operator?**

The instanceof in Java is also known as type comparison operator because it compares the instance with type. It returns either true or false. If we apply the instanceof operator with any variable that has a null value, it returns false.

## **Q3.What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?**

Abstraction hides the implementation details whereas encapsulation wraps code and data into a single unit.

## **Q4.What are the differences between abstract class and interface?**

| Abstract class | Interface |
| --- | --- |
| Abstract class can have abstract and non-abstract methods. | Interface can have only abstract methods. Since Java 8, it can have default and static methods also. |
| Abstract class doesn't support multiple inheritance. | Interface supports multiple inheritance. |
| Abstract class can have final, non-final, static and non-static variables. | Interface has only static and final variables. |
| Abstract class can provide the implementation of interface. | Interface can't provide the implementation of abstract class. |
| The abstract keyword is used to declare abstract class. | The interface keyword is used to declare interface. |
| An abstract class can extend another Java class and implement multiple Java interfaces. | An interface can extend another Java interface only. |
| An abstract class can be extended using keyword "extends". | An interface can be implemented using keyword "implements". |
| Example: public abstract class Shape{} | Example: public interface Drawable{} |


## **Q5.What is a superclass?**

A superclass—also called a base class—is a class that is a parent for more classes rather than objects. It usually contains the most basic code and data that will be used by every class and object under it. Using the above example, ‘beverage’ and ‘machine’ could be superclasses for ‘soda’ and ‘computer.’

## **Q6.What is a subclass?**

A subclass is a class that falls under a superclass. It inherits from the superclass and is considered to have an “is-a” relationship with the superclass.

## **Q7.Are there any limitations of Inheritance?**

Yes, with more powers comes more complications. Inheritance is a very powerful feature in OOPs, but it has some limitations too. Inheritance needs more time to process, as it needs to navigate through multiple classes for its implementation. Also, the classes involved in Inheritance - the base class and the child class, are very tightly coupled together. So if one needs to make some changes, they might need to do nested changes in both classes. Inheritance might be complex for implementation, as well. So if not correctly implemented, this might lead to unexpected errors or incorrect outputs.

## **Q8.What are the various types of inheritance?**

- Single inheritance
- Multiple inheritances
- Multi-level inheritance
- Hierarchical inheritance
- Hybrid inheritance

## **Q9. What is meant by static polymorphism?**

Static Polymorphism is commonly known as the Compile time polymorphism. Static polymorphism is the feature by which an object is linked with the respective function or operator based on the values during the compile time. Static or Compile time Polymorphism can be achieved through Method overloading or operator overloading.
