# **Area of a Rectangle**

## **Problem Statement**

Design a class called Rectangle. It contains two data members as length(L) and breadth(B); and a member function getArea(). The member function computes the area of the given rectangle and returns it to the caller.

Note:

    Area of a rectangle = length x breadth

**Data Members:**

    1. length: Length of the rectangle
    2. breadth: Breadth of the rectangle 

**Member Functions:**

    1. getArea(): that calculates the area of the rectangle and returns the value.

Note:

    You do not have to take input, just create the Class and set the name of the Data Members and function as given in the above discription.

## **Detailed explanation**

**Input Format:**

    The only line of input contains two integers, both separated by a single space denoting the length and breadth respectively.

**Output Format:**

    The only line of output prints the area of the rectangle.

**Constraints:**

    1 <= L, B <= 100

**Sample Input 1:**
    
    4 20

**Sample Output 1:**

    80

**Sample Input 2:**

    2 10

**Sample Output 2:**
